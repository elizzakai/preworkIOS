## Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

1. forest app: tree shopping and coin collection through focusing
2. instagram: reels swiping right for more
3. memrise: listen to locals speak in video form

## Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

i like a mental health checkin app with a weather theme, so you note hoe you feel and it uses weather themology to change the vibes of the app, like cloudy etc. there should be an animated load screen and i want to have an intro of things and introducing to the use of the app. then theres like the clear log feature as the forefront with the clouds and weather as the 3d ish background foreground and then theres like the weather of the week type of thing and then there will be a popup if you have had no sunny cloudy days recently for a more personal checkin
